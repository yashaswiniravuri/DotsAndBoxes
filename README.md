# DotsAndBoxes
Developed Dots and Boxes game in python that allows two or more players to connect dots and form a box. The game can also be played with the computer as one of the players. The grid size of the dots is flexible. Python’s Numpy 2D arrays are used to store horizontal and vertical lines drawn. Whenever a line is drawn from one point to another, the coordinates are captured and used to check if the lines drawn form a box.
